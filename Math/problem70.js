/* 
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

eg1. 
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

eg2.
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45

*/

var climbStairs = function(n) {
    //assuming n is only a positive integer and can only go up and not down
    //base case if one step
    if (n <= 1) return 1;

    //else we return a basic fibonaci sequence of n-1 and n-2
    return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2);
